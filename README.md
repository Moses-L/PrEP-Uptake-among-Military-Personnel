# PrEP-Uptake-among-Military-Personnel
Analysis of survey of 400 military personnel in Abuja, Nigeria, examined PrEP uptake. Participants were predominantly male (70%) with a median age of 34. While attitudes toward PrEP’s efficacy (µ = 3.1, σ = 0.89) and promotion (µ = 3.2, σ = 0.77) were positive, 63% had never considered its use. Significant associations emerged between PrEP attitudes and demographics, including gender (χ² = 41.26, p = 0.032), service arm (χ² = 42.26, p = 0.003), rank (χ² = 36.27, p = 0.014), years of service (χ² = 64.38, p = 0.001), and marital status (χ² = 45.61, p = 0.001). Logistic regression showed that disclosure to family and friends significantly reduced uptake ( β = 0.244, Exp(B) = 1.276, p = 0.037).
